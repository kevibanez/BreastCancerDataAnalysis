\f0\b \cf2 Background: 
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cf2 \cb3 Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer death among women worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis significantly improves the prognosis and survival rates. Machine learning models can aid in this diagnosis, but the success of these models relies heavily on the quality and relevance of the features they're trained on. Determining which features are most influential in predicting malignant tumors can enhance model performance and provide insights into the biological and clinical significance of these features.
